\f0\fs24 \cf0 depression:\
\
1. Thank you for giving us an outlet to tell our stories. It feels good to be able to share my experience with other people who are experiencing the same thing.\
\
2. This is such a great idea for a site. There are days where the pain is difficult to endure and my meds barely put a dent in it. \
\
anxiety: \
\
1. Some days it\'92s all that I can do to leave the house. Everything worries me and I have trouble keeping it together. \
\
2. I\'92m just so nervous all the time but I know that it will pass. If anyone else feels this way my thoughts go out to them and I hope they\'92re ok. \
\
\
bipolar disorder:\
\
1. It\'92s a roller coaster. One minute I feel great and the next it\'92s as if I\'92ve crashed to the ground and can barely recover. \
\
2. The other day I told a friend that I didn\'92t want to speak with them and the next minute i was in tears. It\'92s so hard to maintain any perspective on what matters. \
\
dementia:\
\
1. I can\'92t remember my children\'92s names sometimes. There are times when I\'92m not even sure what year it is and I can feel my grip on reality slipping. \
\
2. Thank you for making this site. I\'92m using it when I feel like I\'92m having a good day and it really helps. \
\
adhd:\
\
1. My meds sometimes get off and it\'92s hard to focus. I try really hard to pay attention in class but I suddenly find myself talking while the teacher is talking and I can\'92t control it. Right now I\'92m thinking about something else already. Thank you for such a cool site. \
\
2. For a long time, the doctors told me that it was all in my head but I knew it was real. I finally found a good doctor and got help. Things have been better since but it\'92s still hard. \
\
schizophrenia:\
\
1. I\'92ve been hospitalized so many times that I\'92ve lost count. As a kid, I used to tell people that I was at camp when I\'92d have an episode. Things are hard but I\'92m doing better right now. \
\
2. My doc is trying to dial in my meds but things are all over the place and I\'92m having a lot of trouble. Just focusing is difficult but I\'92m hanging on and trusting that things will even out. \
 \
ocd:\
\
1. This is such a great site. It could really use a site where people can express their love for other people suffering though. And maybe a button for that kind of thing. \
\
2. Thank you for giving us a place to express how I feel. It really helps to write things down and share them. That button is the most beautiful thing I\'92ve ever seen and whoever set up the D3 is a genius. \
\
autism:\
\
1. My parents worry about me all the time. It\'92s easier for me to type than it is to talk to anyone so this is incredibly cathartic. \
\
2. I can\'92t deal with people. There\'92s so much I want to say but it\'92s impossible for me to get it out. I hope things will get better. \
\
ptsd:\
\
1. Since coming home from the last tour it\'92s been brutal. My moods are all over the place and I have nightmares every night. Things have to get better. \
\
2. Thanks for making this site. I\'92ll tell my friends about it and hopefully it will help them as much as it\'92s helping me. \
