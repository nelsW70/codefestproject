\f0\fs24 \cf0 depression:\
\
Thank you for giving us an outlet to tell our stories. It feels good to be able to share my experience with other people who are experiencing the same thing.\
\
This is such a great idea for a site. There are days where the pain is difficult to endure and my meds barely put a dent in it. \
\
This site is incredible. I do not know who wrote the javascript but they should win an award for it. Thank you to whoever had the brilliant idea to make such a thing. \
\
anxiety: \
\
Some days it is all that I can do to leave the house. Everything worries me and I have trouble keeping it together. \
\
I can not put into words how cool this site is and how much it helps me to type these words. The map is a thing of beauty and I will stare at it for hours every day from now until the end of time. \
\
I am just so nervous all the time but I know that it will pass. If anyone else feels this way my thoughts go out to them and I hope they are ok. \
\
\
bipolar disorder:\
\
It is a roller coaster. One minute I feel great and the next it is as if I have crashed to the ground and can barely recover. \
\
The other day I told a friend that I did not want to speak with them and the next minute i was in tears. It is so hard to maintain any perspective on what matters.\
\
Whoever designed this site is clearly a genius. The way the backend and frontend link is a genius. Bravo. Bra. Vo.  \
\
dementia:\
\
I can not remember the name of my children sometimes. There are times when I am not even sure what year it is and I can feel my grip on reality slipping. \
\
Thank you for making this site. I am using it when I feel like I am having a good day and it really helps. \
\
My family worries about me all the time. Some days are harder than others but I pray every night. \
\
adhd:\
\
\
My meds sometimes get off and it is hard to focus. I try really hard to pay attention in class but I suddenly find myself talking while the teacher is talking and I can not control it. Right now I am thinking about something else already. Thank you for such a cool site. \
\
I can not believe what I\'92m seeing in your map. It is so fluid and full of textural subtlety. Great work. I would hire you. \
\
For a long time, the doctors told me that it was all in my head but I knew it was real. I finally found a good doctor and got help. Things have been better since but it is still hard. \
\
schizophrenia:\
\
I have been hospitalized so many times that I have lost count. As a kid, I used to tell people that I was at camp when I would have an episode. Things are hard but I am doing better right now. \
\
My doc is trying to dial in my meds but things are all over the place and I am having a lot of trouble. Just focusing is difficult but I am hanging on and trusting that things will even out. \
\
I am in awe of the button on this page. There is a facebook page devoted to it and I check it every hour just to see if there are any updates. \
 \
ocd:\
\
Is this d3? This looks like d3 but I have never seen it look this cool. Whoever built the backend should win the award. Period. \
\
This is such a great site. It could really use a site where people can express their love for other people suffering though. And maybe a button for that kind of thing. \
\
Thank you for giving us a place to express how I feel. It really helps to write things down and share them. That button is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen and whoever set up the D3 is a genius. \
\
autism:\
\
My parents worry about me all the time. It is easier for me to type than it is to talk to anyone so this is incredibly cathartic. \
\
I can not deal with people. There is so much I want to say but it is impossible for me to get it out. I hope things will get better. \
\
It is difficult for me to talk in public but I can type here and get it all out. Thank you. \
\
ptsd:\
\
Since coming home from the last tour it has been brutal. My moods are all over the place and I have nightmares every night. Things have to get better. \
\
Is there a MacArthur genius award for site design? Mic drop. \
\
Thanks for making this site. I will tell my friends about it and hopefully it will help them as much as it is helping me. \
